Project Title: Financial Analytics

**Domain:** Finance

**Technologies:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

**Difficulty Level:** Basic-Intermediate

**Problem Statement:**

 Without analyzing the competition, it is difficult for a business to survive. I was
tasked to analyse the competition for the management to provide better results. This
data set has information on the market capitalization of the top 500 companies in India.
Serial NumberNameName of CompanyMar Cap – CroreMarket Capitalization in
CroresSales Qtr – CroreQuarterly Sale in crores. Find key metrics and factors and
show the meaningful relationships between attributes.

**Key Performance Indicators Analyzed:**

***Understanding the Data:***

- Data Quality: Ensured data cleanliness and accuracy by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

- Data Structure: Focused on columns like Market Capitalization and Quarterly Sales.

***Key Metrics:***

- Market Capitalization: Identified the top 10 companies by market capitalization.
- Quarterly Sales: Identified the top 10 companies by quarterly sales.
- Growth Rates: Calculated growth rates for both market capitalization and quarterly sales.

***Relationships and Correlations:***

- Correlation Analysis: Identified the strength and direction of relationships between market capitalization and quarterly sales.
- Scatter Plots: Visualized the correlation to understand the relationship better.

***Visualization Techniques:*** 
Used bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to present data.


***Findings:***

- Average Market Cap-to-Sales Ratio: The average market cap-to-sales ratio of 15.38 indicates that, on average, companies have a market capitalization 15.38 times their quarterly sales.
- Positive Correlation: There is a positive correlation between market capitalization and quarterly sales, suggesting that as a company grows in market value, its sales also tend to increase.
- Negative Growth Rates: Both market cap and sales growth rates are negative, indicating a decline in both market value and sales revenue for many companies.

***Conclusion:***

In this project, I found an average market cap-to-sales ratio of 15.38. Despite negative growth rates in both market cap and quarterly sales, the positive correlation indicates that as market cap increases, quarterly sales also tend to increase. This suggests that larger companies with higher market capitalization generally have higher sales. However, the overall decline in growth rates indicates that these companies are facing challenges in maintaining their previous growth momentum.
